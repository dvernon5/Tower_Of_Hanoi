# Tower Of Hanoi Solver

## About Tower of Hanoi Solver  
Welcome to the Tower of Hanoi Solver! This project presents a console-based C++ implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a classic mathematical challenge known for its elegant recursive solution. 

## What is the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle? 
The Tower of Hanoi puzzle consists of three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all the disks from one peg (the source) to another peg (the destination) while following these rules. 

1. You can only move one disk at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. You can use an auxilliary peg (the intermediate peg) to achieve the goal.

## Feature of This Application:
* User Input: The program allows you to specify the number of disks you want to use in the puzzle, making it adaptable for various difficulty levels.
* Efficient Solution: It implements the Tower of Hanoi algorithm to solve the puzzle optimally, minimizing the number of moves required.
* Clear Output: The application provides clear and informative output, showing each step of the solution process, so you can understand how the puzzle is being solved.

## Getting Started:  
To get started, you need a C++ compiler to build and run this program. Clone the repository, compile the code, and follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of disks. You'll then witness the Tower of Hanoi puzzle being solved step by step.

## Enjoy Solving the Puzzle:  
Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, exploring the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and its elegant recursive solution can be both educational and entertaining. Have fun solving the puzzle and exploring the code!
